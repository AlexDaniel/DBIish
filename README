=head1 NAME
FakeDBI - an interim database interface for Rakudo Perl 6

=head1 DESCRIPTION
The roadmap for DBI v2 L<http://search.cpan.org/~timb/DBI/Roadmap.pod>
published in November 2004 laid out the plans for Perl 5 and 6.
Specifically there is a Parrot DBDI project that will give the same DBD
facilities to any Parrot based language.  See also
http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/2005/07/msg22054.html

Because no code is available yet, this project plans to temporarily fill
the gap, by imitating the classic DBI interface.  Although this is not
on the roadmap, let's say if it looks like a DBI, and it talks like a
DBI, then it is a DBI.

=head1 DBD CLASSES
Whilst it is convenient, the FakeDBD drivers stay together with the
FakeDBI files in a single project.  In future each FakeDBD may become a
separate project, although this conflicts a bit with the idea of being
"temporary".

The documention of the FakeDBI and the FakeDBD modules, and also this
README, is in the proposed Pod6 format, with the intention of increasing
experience with its use.  View it with an appropriate formatter if your
system has one.
