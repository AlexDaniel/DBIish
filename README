=head1 NAME
fakeDBI - a tiny subset of DBI in Perl 6

=head1 DESCRIPTION
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. As the github repo heading
says, this is a subset of the Perl 5 DBI written in Perl 6.
The people in #perl6 at irc.freenode.net talk about how the future DBI
will be so much better, yada, yada but there is no code to use :(

The right way to do Perl 6 DBI involves NCI, PIR, sockets and so on. The
job is hard and very time consuming. Factor in DBI enhancements and it's
obviously not going to be ready by Christmas :(

Whoever really wants to access a database from Rakudo today is referred
to the run() command. Well, this code uses the run() command :)

=head1 DESIGN GOALS
L<CRUD|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete>
operations on common SQL databases is enough. The run() command executes
command line client programs such as sqlite3, mysql and psql.

Much Perl 5 code will migrate well to Perl 6 if modules are similar.
This code helps the Perl 6 adopter keep as much as possible the same.

=head1 LICENSE
No. Others do too much of that already. This code is to scratch the itch
-Ofun and to hopefully be obsoleted ASAP.
