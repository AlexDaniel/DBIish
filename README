=head1 NAME
FakeDBI - an interim database interface for Rakudo Perl 6

=head1 DESCRIPTION
According to reports in perl6-language and #perl6, the DBI for Rakudo
Perl 6 will use a Parrot based database driver interface (DBDI).  See
http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language/2005/07/msg22054.html

Experience with Perl 5 DBI and DBD's motivated changes in the
architecture, so the new DBDI will be like Java's JDBC.  Because no code
is available yet, this project wants to temporarily fill the gap, just
copying the Perl 5 interface.
